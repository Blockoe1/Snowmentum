# Snowmentum

A 2D side scrolling infinite runner about growing a snowball to destructive sizes.

Known Bugs:
- Backgrounds will break if the snowball gets too large (Only happens past bracket 5.)
- The first time the main theme loops, there's an auditory stutter.


Everything is controlled with the mouse/trackpad/trackball.  There are no button inputs required; however, you can use the joystick and buttons on arcade, or arrow keys/wasd and spacebar/enter on PC to navigate menus.
