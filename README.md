# Snowmentum

A 2D side scrolling infinite runner about growing a snowball to destructive sizes.

Known Bugs:
- Obstacles have a rare chance of screwing the player over by spawning in an impassible line.
- The snoeball sometimes doesnt transition back to the default sprite when it thaws.


Everything is controlled with the mouse/trackpad/trackball.  There are no button inputs required; however, you can use the joystick and top buttons to navigate menus.
