# Snowmentum

A 2D side scrolling infinite runner about growing a snowball to destructive sizes.

Known Bugs:
- Particles can land in the air above the hill.
- Obstacles have a rare chance of screwing the player over by spawning in an impassible line.


Everything is controlled with the mouse/trackpad/trackball.  There are no button inputs required.
